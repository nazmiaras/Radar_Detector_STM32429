# STM32F429 Radar Detector
## Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a radar detector using the STM32F429 microcontroller. The project was developed using the STM32CubeIDE IDE.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to learn how to create a radar detector using the STM32F429 microcontroller. The project uses a PWM signal to control an SG90 servo motor. HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor is placed on this servo motor to measure the distance. The angle and distance of the objects are then transmitted to a computer using UART.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:

- STM32F429ZI Nucleo Development Board
- STM32CubeIDE IDE
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
- SG-90 Servo Motor
